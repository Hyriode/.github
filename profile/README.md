Hyriode was a Minecraft mini-games network based in France. Every day, we were innovating and in search of new features to add. We only wanted to give an amazing Minecraft server to the community, where everybody could play with friends, discover new mini-games and meet new people.

### 🧭 Our goals

The two main things that we put forward at Hyriode were the creativity 🖌️ and the quality 💎. Why those ?

- Creativity because we wanted to innovate 💡 in our mini-games: by adding new features or by remaking some others if our community wanted to.
- Quality because we wanted to provide 🎁 to players the best playing experience: no lag, no bugs and stuff.

It's a challenge that we took every day, but it was not always easy to achieve it 😄
