Hyriode is a Minecraft mini-games network based in France. Every day, we are innovating and in search of new features to add. We only want to give an amazing Minecraft server to the community, where everybody can play with friends, discover new mini-games and meet new people.

### 🧭 Our goals

The two main, things that we put forward at Hyriode is the creativity 🖌️ and the quality 💎. Why those ?

- Creativity because we want to innovate 💡 in our mini-games: by adding new features or by remaking some others if our community wants to, etc.
- Quality because we want to provide 🎁 to players the best playing experience: no lag, no bugs and stuff.

It's a challenge that we take every day, but it's not always easy to achieve it 😄


### 💻 Technologies

At Hyriode we always want to improve ourselves by discovering new technologies or simply by practising and learning new things every day.<br>
So what technologies do we use ?

- Java: it's the main language used at Hyriode. It is used to create plugins, applications and understand the basics of Minecraft.
- Docker/K8s: K8s and Docker are in our opinions two of the best technologies that exist in the world. Our entire infrastructure is made with these!
- Netty: Netty is a very powerful Java framework that we use for our internals RestAPIs
- Redis/MongoDB: Redis and MongoDB are just amazing for the use that we have. Some examples: storing players data, network data, leaderboards, etc.
- InfluxDB: Another database that we use to have many useful metrics of the server.

We used many others, but it would take too long to list them all.
